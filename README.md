## What is Extruct AI?

**Extruct AI** is a data enrichment platform that lets you create custom tables with any columns you want, and then enrich them with company data from the web and public sources.  

- **Any info you want:** Define your own columns — get emails, social links, funding, tech stack, or anything else.
- **No limits:** Works for any company, in any country, any industry.
- **Built for automation:** Integrate with CRMs, lead gen, analytics, and more.



## Features

- Add a company to your Extruct table and trigger enrichment
- Poll for enrichment completion automatically
- Instantly fetch the enriched row with all your custom columns
- Use in any n8n workflow



## Installation

Follow the [n8n community nodes documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/) for installing custom nodes.



## Usage

1. **Create an Extruct table:**
   - You can start from a template table or create your own from scratch at [Extruct AI](https://extruct.ai).
   - Add any custom columns you need — you have full control over the table structure and fields.
2. **Get your Table ID:**
   - After creating the table, copy its Table ID from the Extruct dashboard, or simply grab it from the table page URL.
3. **Use in n8n:**
   - In the Extruct node, paste your Table ID.
   - Enter the company name or website you want to enrich:
     - You can type it manually in the node field,
     - Or pass it dynamically from a Form Trigger,
     - Or from any other node in your workflow — just connect it to the Extruct node.
   - Run the workflow — the node will add the company, trigger enrichment, and return the enriched data for your custom columns.

## Quick Demo

## Operations

### Enrich Company Info

**How it works:**  
1. Adds a company to your Extruct table  
2. Triggers enrichment  
3. Waits for completion  
4. Returns the enriched row (with all your custom fields)



## Output
The node returns clean JSON with all enriched fields for the company, matching your custom table columns.
